# Arduino SOS Morse Code (LED)

This project uses an LED connected to pin 8 of an Arduino board to blink the SOS signal (`... --- ...`) in international Morse code.  
Timing follows Morse rules:
- Dot: 1 unit
- Dash: 3 units
- Space between parts of a letter: 1 unit
- Space between letters: 3 units
- Space between words: 7 units
